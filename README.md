How it works:
Go ahead and download the files and install the dependencies, start the program and enter the paths for your folders and your Saucenao API key.
If you want to run it automatically with Conjob, you can add the argument "--SkipPrompts." But you'll need to configure the .env file, which you can do when you start it manually for the first time.
